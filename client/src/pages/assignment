Let me break down this rescue mission planning problem in a clear, organized way:

Core Objective:
- Design a system to coordinate rescue teams searching for lost people in a forest divided into zones
- Optimize team movements, manage resources, and track rescued individuals efficiently

Key Components:

1. Zone Management:
- Forest is split into multiple zones
- Each zone has:
  * Priority level (1-5, where 1 is highest priority)
  * People needing rescue
  * Available supplies
  * Must be visited in an efficient order

2. Rescue Teams Operation:
- Teams need to move between zones
- Must avoid backtracking
- Have limited supplies (first aid, food, etc.)
- Need to handle supplies strategically

3. Tracking System:
- Must record details of rescued people
- Track rescue timing
- Allow quick updates and information retrieval
- Maintain dynamic priority updates

4. Required Data Structures:
- Priority Queue: For managing zone priorities and rescue order
- Queue: For managing team movements between zones
- Stack: For resource/supply management
- Binary Tree: For tracking rescued individuals

5. System Requirements:
- Must handle dynamic updates
- Be user-friendly
- Efficiently manage and update priorities
- Optimize resource usage

The challenge essentially asks you to create a comprehensive rescue mission management system using various data structures to efficiently coordinate multiple aspects of a rescue operation. The focus is on both the practical aspects (like resource management and rescue prioritization) and the technical implementation (using appropriate data structures for different functionalities).

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of this problem? For instance, I could:
1. Dive deeper into the data structures needed
2. Explain how the priority system would work
3. Discuss the resource management approach
